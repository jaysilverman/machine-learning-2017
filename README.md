# Machine Learning 2017

This repository contains machine learning projects for the following data science competitions sponsored by Drivendata (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions):

* DengAI (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread)
* Predict Blood Donations (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations)
* Water Pump Failure (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table)

## Usage
Each project consists of one or more Jupyter notebooks (i.e. file with .ipynb suffix). These projects require that you have a Python 3.6 environment setup with the following packages:

	jupyter
	matplotlib
	numpy
	pandas
	seaborn
	scikit-learn

The easiest way to setup this environment is to install the Anaconda Python 3.6 distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download). Anaconda already has the necessary packages pre-installed. After cloning this repository run the command "jupyter-notebook" from the newly created machine-learning-2017 directory. In the webpage which is automatically displayed in your web browser navigate to the project you wish to run and click on the Jupyter notebook.
