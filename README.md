# Machine Learning 2017

This repository contains machine learning projects for the following data science competitions sponsored by Drivendata (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions):

* DengAI (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread)
* Predict Blood Donations (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations)
* Water Pump Failure (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table)

## Usage
These projects consist of one or more Jupyter notebooks. To run the notebooks you need to have a Python 3.6 environment setup with the following packages:

	jupyter
	matplotlib
	numpy
	pandas
	scikit-learn
	seaborn

The easiest way to setup this environment is to install the Anaconda Python 3.6 distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download). Anaconda already has the necessary packages pre-installed. After cloning this repository run the command "jupyter notebook" from the machine-learning-2017 directory. On the notebook dashboard which shows a list of subdirectories click on a project folder and select one of the Jupyter notebook files (i.e. file with .ipynb suffix). If you need help using the Jupyter notebook you can find documentation here (https://jupyter.readthedocs.io).
