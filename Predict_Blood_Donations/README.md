Drivendata sponsors data science competitions (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions). One of those competitions involves predicting blood donations. This particular competition is designed to be an introduction to Drivendata. It involves a very small dataset with a few features. This project is my attempt to use Scikit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org) to predict the probability of individuals donating blood. At the time of my best submission my score was ranked 99 out of approximately 3000 competitors.
