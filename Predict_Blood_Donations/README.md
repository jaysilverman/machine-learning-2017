# Predict Blood Donations

This project contains the Jupyter notebook which I used to participate in the Drivendata Predict Blood Donations competition (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations). This particular competition is designed to be an introduction to Drivendata. It involves a very small dataset with five features and 576 examples in the training dataset. This project was my attempt to use Python and Scikit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org) to predict the probability of individuals donating blood. 

At the time of my best submission my score (0.4376) was ranked 99 out of approximately 3000 competitors.
