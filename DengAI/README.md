Drivendata sponsors data science competitions to solve problems for nonprofits (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions). One of those competitions involves predicting the number of weekly Dengue Fever cases in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. The dataset for this competition contains meteorlogical information (air temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc). The dataset is very small and has a small number of features. One of the problems one has to overcome is that the dataset has quite a few missing values. The most interesting aspect of the dataset is that it involves a time series (i.e. each record represents one week over a period of several years). If one is creative one can figure out how to add new features using time series analysis. At the time of my best submission my score was ranked 46 out of approximately 1700 competitors.
