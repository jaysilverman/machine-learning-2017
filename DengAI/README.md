# DengAI

This project contains the Jupyter notebook which I used to participate in the Drivendata DengAI competition (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/). The dataset for this competition is very small with 24 features and 1456 examples in the training dataset. This project was my attempt to use Python and Scikit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org) to predict the number of weekly Dengue Fever cases in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru.  One of the problems one has to overcome in this competition is that the dataset has quite a few missing values. The dataset is interesting because it involves a time series (i.e. each example represents a period of one week and the dataset covers a period of several years). I found that in order to score well one has to be creative and add new features using time series analysis.

At the time of my best submission my score (20.3462) was ranked 46 out of approximately 1700 competitors.
